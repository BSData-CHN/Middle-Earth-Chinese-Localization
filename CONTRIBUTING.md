Details of how to work on BattleScribe data files can be found on the [BSData Catalogue Development Wiki][].

In addition to our [Code of Conduct][] please remember these guidelines:

- Be polite. Everyone here gets no money for this work. It's open-source community.
- Don't complain, but instead try to fix it. Or at least open an issue. Someone probably will fix it.
- Spend only spare time here. You won't get money for this.
- Try to fix current issues first.
